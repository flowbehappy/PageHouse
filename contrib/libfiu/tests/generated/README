These are autogenerated tests for testing the posix preload, to make sure the
functions are getting properly wrapped.

Each test is configured by a .conf file in the conf/ directory.

These are the allowed options ('-' means mandatory, '*' optional):
 - fp: failure point corresponding to the function.
 - call: how to call the function.
 * prep: preparation steps (usually declaring variables).
 * include: list of files to #include, space separated.
 * success_cond: condition we expect to be true if the call succeeds.
 * failure_cond: condition we expect to be true after we simulate a failure
	(if not set, we will only validate that we simulated the failure).
 * errno_on_fail: simulate this errno on failure.

It is mandatory that a single section is defined; however, the name is only
for description purposes.
